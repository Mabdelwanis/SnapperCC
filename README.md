# SnapperCC - Useful utility for Snapper2!

Snapper2 is an awesome tweak by https://twitter.com/jontelang . However the only way to invoke the tweak is using the default screenshot gesture as Activator has not been updated. I like to keep the default screenshot gesture & use snapper at my own will! So I created a CC Toggle to invoke Snapper2!
The tweak requires CCSupport installed & you can configure what mode the CC Toggle will invoke (Normal/Instant) from the Control Center Settings itself! The tweak will dismiss the control center & then start the clipping session so that the CC is not captured ;) Also compatible with Prysm!

Kudos to @jontelang for working with me & adding the required listeners to make this happen!
